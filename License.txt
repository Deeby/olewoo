License

To be honest, when it comes to licenses for this sort of thing, Jeff Atwood has a http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/pick-a-license-any-license.html good point

That being said, people ask what license I use, in order that they can conform with adoption policies. 

Therefore, OleWoo uses the http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT license - which essentially says 'do what you want, but don't take credit please'.

If you use/include OleWoo in something cool, drop me a note!
